Kimball lifecycle

The Kimball lifecycle is a methodology for developing data warehouses, and has been developed 
by Ralph Kimball and a variety of colleagues. The methodology "covers a sequence of high level 
tasks for the effective design, development and deployment" of a data warehouse or business intelligence system. 
It is considered a "bottom-up" approach to data warehousing as pioneered by Ralph Kimball,
in contrast to the older "top-down" approach pioneered by Bill Inmon.
